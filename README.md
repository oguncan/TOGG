## The project structure

For this project, i focused to solve the problem using only the GetX resources and following the below structure i feel good about the results,  the simplicity to understand the project and its rules.

```yaml
- lib/src/generated
# Proto generated files

- /lib/pages
# This is the folder who we have to get more attention and
# careful to manage the structure becaouse GetX can be used in 
# many different ways, and a wrong way maybe can broken you app 
# in the future, so because that, i defined some rules:
    - /page_name
        # RULE 1: For all pages, we have to create a folder
        # named with our page name where we can create the 
        # appropriate files.
        - screen.dart
        # RULE 2: Design
        - controller.dart
        # RULE 3: Every page, in most of cases, will need to
        # implement a controller to take care about some 
        # particular data and functions for this page. How this 
        # controller is initialized in a GetBuilder on index.
        # dart, it only will be available and alive while this 
        # page is in use, for any other case, this controller 
        # will not be available. 
        - binding.dart   
- lib/utils
# Used for generic purposes the utils implements functions 
# to be used in the most parts of our project without 
# dependencies of other files.

- lib/components

- application.dart

- main.dart
# This file is the point of start of application, it means that 
# if it dispose, the app should closes too. This file has the
# responsability to initialize the GetX context, start our 
# AppController for global purposes and implement all 
# the route screens to allow navigations. Also, to initialize 
# the AppController in this file, i make use of 
# Get.put(AppController()) because the use of named_routes in 
# the GetMaterialApp does not instance any Widget direcly, 
# therefore, it cannot be used with GetBuild.

- lib/router/*
```
